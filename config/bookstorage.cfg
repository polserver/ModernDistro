	title	A politic call to anarchy
	contents	{     Let it never be said , that I have aught as , quarrel with my liege , Lord British, for , indeed we be of the , best of friends, , sharing amicable , games of chess 'pon , winter's night, and , talking at length into , the wee hours of the , issues that affect the , realm of Britannia., ,     Yet true friendship , doth not prevent true , philosophical , disagreement either. , While I view with , approval my lord's , affection for his , carefully crafted , philosophy of the , Eight Virtues, , wherein moral , behavior is encouraged , in the populace, I view , with less approval the , expenditure of public , funds upon the , construction of , "shrines" to said , ideals., ,     The issue is not one , of funds, however, , but a disagreement , most intellectual over , the proper way of , humankind in an , ethical sense. Surely , freedom of decision , must be regarded as , paramount in any , such moral decision? , Though none fail to , censure the , murderer, a subtler , question arises when , we ask if his behavior , would be ethical if he , were forced to it., ,     I say to thee, the , reader, quite flatly, , that no ethical system , shall have sway over , me unless it , convinceth me, for , that freely made , choice is to me the , sigh that the system , has validity., ,     Whereas the , system of "Virtues" , that my liege espouses , is indeed a compilation , of commonly approved , virtues, I approve of , it. Where it seeks to , control the populace , and restrict their , diversity and their , range of behaviors, I , quarrel with it. And , thus do I issue this , politic call to anarchy, , whilst humbly , begging forgivness of , Lord British for my , impertinence:, ,     Celebrate thy , differences. Take thy , actions according to , they own lights. , Question from what , source a law, a rule, a , judge, and a virtue , may arise. 'Twere , possible (though I , suggest it not , seriously) that a , daemon planted the , seed of these "Virtues" , in my Lord British's , mind; 'twere possible , that the Shrines were , but a plan to destroy , this world. Thou canst , not know unless thou , questioneth, doubteth, , and in the end, unless , thou relyest upon , THYSELF and they , judgement. I offer , these words as mere , philosophical musings , for those who seek , enlightenment, for 'tis , the issue that hath , occupied mine interest , and that of Lord , British for some time , now., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	Virtues
	contents	{ Within this world live , people with many , different ideals, and , this is good. Yet what , is it within the people , of our land that sorts , out the good from the , evil, the cherished , from the disdained? , Virtue, I say it is, and , virtue is the logical , outcome of a people , who wish to live , together in a bonded , society., ,     For without Virtues , as a code of conduct , which people maintain , in their relations with , each other, the fabric , of that society will , become weakened. For , a society to grow and , prosper for all, each , must grant the others , a common base of , consideration., ,     I call this base the , Virtues. For though , one person might gain , personal advantage by , breaching such a code, , the society as a whole , would suffer., ,     There are three , Principle Virtues that , should guide people to , enlightenment. These , are: Truth, Love, and , Courage. From all the , infinite reasons one , may have to found an , action, such as greed , or charity, envy or , pity, the three , Principle Virtues , stand out., ,     In fact all other , virtues and vices can , be shown to be built , from these principles , and their opposite , corruption's of , Falsehood, Hatred and , Cowardice. These , three Principles can , be combined in eight , ways, which I will , call the eight virtues. , The eight virtues , which we should , build our society upon , follow., ,     Truth alone becomes , Honesty, for without , honesty between our , people, how can we , build the trust which , is needed to maximize , our successes., ,     Love alone becomes , compassion, for at , some time or another , all of us will need the , compassion of others, , and most likely , compassion will be , shown to those who , have shown it., ,     Courage alone , becomes Valor, , without valor our , people will never , reach into the , unknown or to the , risky and will never , achieve., ,     Truth tempered by , Love gives us Justice, , for only in loving , search for the truth , can one dispense fair , Justice, rather than , create a cold and , callous people., ,     Love and Courage , gives us Sacrifice, for , a people who love each , other will be willing to , make personal , sacrifices to help , others in need, which , one day, may be , needed in return., ,     Courage and Truth , give us Honor, great , knights know this , well, that chivalric , honor can be found by , adhering to this code , of conduct., ,     Combining Truth, , Love and Courage , suggest the virtue of , Spirituality the virtue , that causes one to be , introspective, to , wonder about ones , place in this world and , whether one's deeds , will be recorded as a , gift to the world or a , plague., ,     The final Virtue is , more complicated. For , the eighth combination , is that devoid of , Truth, Love or Courage , which can only exist , in a state of great , Pride, which of , course is not a virtue , at all. Perhaps this , trick of fate is a test , to see if one can , realize that the true , virtue is that of , Humility. I feel that , the people of Magincia , fail to see this to such , a degree that I would , not be surprised if , some ill fate awaited , their future., ,     Thus from the , infinite possibilities , which spawned the , Three Principles of , Truth, Love and , Courage, come the , Eight Virtues of , Honesty, Compassion, , Valor, Justice, , Sacrifice, Honor, , Spirituality, and , Humility., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	On the diversity of our land
	contents	{     While I deplore the , depredations of the , misguided and , belligerent races , with which we , share our fair , Britannia, and , alongside the populace , do mourn the needless , deaths that their raids , cause, I cannot , countenance the policy , of wholesale , slaughter of these , races that seems to be , the habity of our , soldierly element. Can , we not regard the , ratmen, lizard men, , and orcs are fellow , intelligent beings with , whom we share a , planet? Why must we , slay them on sight, , rather than attempt to , engage them in , dialogue? There is no , policy of shooting at , wisps when they , grace us with their , presence (not that an , arrow could do much , to pierce them!)., ,     To view these , creatures as vermin , denies their obvious , intelligence, and we , cannot underestimate , the repercussions that , their slaughter may , have. If we regard the , slaying of fellow , humans as a crime, so , must we regard the , killing of an orc., ,     At the same time, , should a lizardman , slay a human, whould , we not forgive their , ignorance and , foolishness? Let us , not surrender the , high moral ground by , descending to , bestiality., ,     Now, I say not that , we should fail to , defend ourselves in , case of attack, for , even amongst humans , we see war, we see , famine, and we see , assault (though we , owe a debt of gratitude , to our Lord British for , preserving us from , the worst of these!). , However, incursions , such as the recent , tragedy which cost us , the life of Japheth, , Guildmaster of , Trinsic's Paladins, , are folly., ,     I had met Japheth, , and like all paladins, , he burned with an , inner fire. Yet though , I had the utmost , respect for him, none , could deny the hatred , that flashed in his , eyes the mere mention , of orcs. And thus he , carried his battle to , the orc camps, and , died there, unable to , rise above his own , childhood experiences , depicted in his book, , "The Burning of , Trinsic." 'Tis a shame , that even our , mightiest men fall , prey to this ignorance!, ,     Are there not , legends of orcs , adopting human , children to raise as , their own? Tales of , complex societies built , underground by races , we regard as bestial?, ,     Let us not repeat the , mistake of Japheth of , the Paladins, and let , us cease to persecute , the nonhuman races, , before we discover , that we are harming , ourselves in the , process., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	Classic tales of Vesper: Volume 1
	contents	{     'Tis an Honor to , present to Thee these , Tales collected from , Ages Past. In this , Inaugural Volume, we , present this Verse oft , Recited as a Lullabye , for sleepy Children., , Preface by Guilhem , the Scholar, ,     The meaning of this , verse has oft been , discussed in halls of , scholarly sorts, for , its mysterious , singsongy melody is , oddly disturbing to , adult ears, though , children seem to find , it restful as they , sleep. Perhaps it is , but the remnant of a , longer ballad once , extant, for there are , internal indications , that it once told a , longer story about , ill-fated lovers, and a , magical experiment , gone awry. However, , poetic license and the , folk process has , distorted the words , until now the locale , of? the tale is no more , than "in the wind," , which while it serves , a pleasingly , metaphorical purpose, , fails to inform the , listener as to any real , locale!, ,     Another possibility , is that this is some , form of creation myth , explaining the genesis , of the various , humanoid creatures , that roam the lands , of? Britannia. It does , not take a stretch of , the imagination to , name the middle , verse's "girl becomes a , tree" as a possible , explanation for the , reaper, for in the area , surrounding Minoc, , reapers are oft , referred to among the , lumber jacking , community as , "widowmakers." That , these creatures are of , arcane origin is , assumed, but the , verse seems to imply a , long ago creator, and , uses the antique , magickal terminology , of "plaiting strands of , ether" that is so often , found in ancient , texts. In addition, the , reference to , "snakehills" may , profitably be regarded , as a reference to an , actual location, such as , perhaps a local term , for the Serpent's , Spine., ,     A commoner , interpretation is that , like many nursery , rhymes, it is a simple , explanation for death, , wherein the wind , snatches up boys and , girls and when they , sleep in order to keep , the balance of the , world. Notable tales , have been written for , children of , adventures in "the , Snakehills," which , are presumed to be an , Afterworld whence , the spirit lives on. A , grim lullabye, to be , sure, but no worse , than "lest I die before I , wake" surely., ,     In either case, 'tis , an old favorite herein , printed for the first , time for thy , enjoyment and , perusal!, , In the Wind where the , Balance Is Whispered , in Hallways, In the Wind where the , Magic Flows All , through the Night, There live Mages and , Mages, With Robes make of , Whole Days, Reading Books full of , Doings, Printed on Light, , In the Wind where the , Lovers Are Crossed , under Shadows, Where they Meet and , are Parted, By the Orders of Fate, The Girl becomes , Tree,, And thus becomes , Widow, The Boy becomes , Earth, And Wanders Till Late, , In the Wind are the , Monster, First Born First , Created, When Chanting and , Ether, Mix Meddling and , Nigh, Fear going to Wind,, Fear Finding its , Plaitings,, Go Not to the , Snakehills, Lest you Care to Die, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	Dimensional travel: A Monograph
	contents	{     'Tis beyond the , scope of this small , monograph to discuss , the details of , moongates, and the , manners in which , they distort the fabric , of reality in such a , manner as to permit , the passage of living , flesh from place to , place, world to world, , or indeed from , dimension to , dimension., ,     Instead, allow me to , bring thy attention, , Gentle Reader, to the , curious , characteristics that , are shared by certain , individuals within our , realm., ,     Long has it been , known that the blue , moongate permits , travel from place to , place, and none have , trouble in taking this , path. Yet 'tis also , known, albeit only to a , few, that certain , individuals are unable , to traverse the black , moongates that permit , travel from one , dimension to another., ,     The noted mage and , peer of our realm, , Lord Blackthorn, once , told me in conversation , that his arcane , research had indicated , that the issue was one , of conservation of , ether. To wit, given , the postulate that , matter within a given , dimension may be but , a cros-section of , ethereal matter that , exists in multiple , dimensions, it , becomes obvious that , said ethereal , structure cannot enter , dimensions in which , it is already present., ,     Imagine an , individual (and the , Lord Blackthorn , hinted that he was one , such) who exist , already in some form , in multiple , dimensions: said , individual would not , be able to cross into , another dimension , because HE IS , ALREADY THERE., ,     The implications of , this are staggering, , and merit further , study. 'Tis well , known by theorists in , the field that , divisions in the , ethereal structure of , an individual are , already implicit at the , temporal level, as , causality forces , divisions upon the , ether. This is the , basic operating , mechanism by which , white moongates , function, permitting , time travel., ,     As time travel is not , barred by the , presence of an earlier , self (though , encountering said , earlier self can prove , arcanely perilous), , there must be some , rigidity to the ethereal , structure that bars , multiple instantiations , of structures from , manifesting within , the same context., ,     If one regards time , and causal bifurcation , as a web, perhaps the , appropriate analogy , for dimensional , matrices is that of a , crystalline structure , with rigid linkages., ,     The only way in , which an individual , such as Lord , Blackthorn, who , exists in multiple , dimensional matrices, , can cross worlds via a , black moongate, would , be for the entire , crystalline structure , of the dimension to , perfectly match the , ethereal resonance of , the destination , dimension., ,     The problem of , why certain , individuals are , already replicated in , multiple crystalline , matrices is one that I , fail to provide any , schema for in these , poor theories. It is my , fondest hope that , someday someone , shall conquer that , thorny problem and , enlighten the world., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	Britannian flora: A casual guide
	contents	{     Oft 'pon rambling , through the woods , avoiding bears have I , spotted some plant , whose like I have , never seen before, and , concluding that I was a , blithering idiot for , failing to notice it in , the past. Equally as , oft have I concluded , that I was a worse , idiot for not running , faster from the bear., ,     While not all my , readers may share , my proclivites for , tree-climbing, it , occurred to me that , mayhap mine , information might , serve some humble , purpose., ,     The two most , unique flower plants , in the Britannian , countryside are the , orfleur and the , whiteflower, also , called white horns., ,     The orfleur is , notable for its massive , orange-red blossoms, , which dwarf , marigolds like the sun , dwarfs you (sic) , common fireball spell. , The odor of said , blooms is best , described as , peppermint-apple, , with a dash of garlic. , 'Tis a popular potted , plant despite, or , perhaps because of, , its exotic nature., ,     Whiteflowers , exude a subtle , fragrance not unlike , that of freshly , shaven wood mixed , with cool lemon ice. , Their tall stands , always droop with the , heavy weight of their , massive blooms, oft as , large as a child's head., ,     The flowers are so , large that one may , scoop out the pollen in , handfuls, and during , the spring season , many a prank hath , been played by idle , boys 'pon their sisters , by dumping said , pollen into their , clothing drawers, , causing sneezes for , days., ,     The most , interesting native tree , to Britannia is the , spider tree. The , reason for its naming , is obscure, but may , have to do with the , twisted gray stalks , from which the , spherical canopy , sprouts. 'Tis , something of a , misnomer to term , these "trunks" as they , are spindly and , flexible.

	title	The wild girl of the forest
	contents	{     Her name was , Leyla, she said, and , her hair was braided , wild with creepers , and thorns. I marveled , that they did not hurt , her, but when I asked, , she but shrugged and , let her eyes roam once , more across the , woods. Though I had , my hands securely , fastened by her , ropes, I itched to reach , out and comb that , unruly golden mane, , dirtied and , leaf-ridden., ,     Her provenance, , she told me over , nights illuminated by , campfires, was once , the city of Trinsic. , She claimed to have , been kidnapped and , raised by orcs, which , I judged an unlikely , tale, for all know orcs , delight in eating the , meat of honest folk. , When I told her this, , she laughed a fey , laugh, and gaily , admitted that honest , she was not, for oft , had she stolen folk , away from caravans , to loot their , possessions from an , unconscious body!, ,     At this, I began to , fear for my life, and , her smile seemed full , of teeth sharper than , a human ought to have, , for the tale of orcish , raising had struck , fear into the marrow , of my bones. "Wil thou , eat me?" I asked, , a-tremble, fearing , the answer., ,     And she cocked her , head at me, like a wild , animal facing a word , that it dost not , understand, and the , fixity in her eyes , was a glimpse into the , deeper reaches of the , Abyss. But she , finally grunted, and , said "Nay," in a voice , that recalled to me a , child. "Nay," she said, , "for thou dost remind , me of a boy I knew , once, when I was a , girl who played in a , city of great sandstone , walls, before I was , taken. He had sandy , hair like thee, and I , dreamt as a child of , holding his hand and , sharing flavored ice. , His name was , Japheth., ,     The next morning , she let me go, stripped , of my pouch and , clothes, and bade me , run through the , woods, and to fear , recapture, for surely , her heart would not , soften again. 'Twas a , fearful run, and I , came to the road to , Yew with welts and , scratches run , rampant crost my , skin, but I did not see , her again., ,     Oft have I wondered , of the boy named , Japheth, and whether , he remembers a girl , who lived in sandstone , walls. The only , Japheth I know is the , Guildmaster of , Paladins who died last , year warring amidst , the orcs, and though , he had indeed sandy , hair, I cannot picture , him side by side with , a feral girl whose , tongue has tasted of , human flesh.

The parapets , and the moat were , places to play, not , stout defenses, and , we gave no thought to , the necessities that , must have required , their construction., ,     We used to reach , the sheltered , orchards on the lee , side of the parapet , walls, where the , southern river cut , through the city, by , swimming across the , water., ,     The rich folk who , lived in the great , manses there would , shout from their , windows and shake , their fists, for we , would run through , their gardens and tear , up the delicate , foxgloves and , orfleurs with our , unshod dirty feet., ,     Then we would dive , into the water and , splash merrily to the , fruit trees., ,     The southern river , lazily slid under an , ungated arch in the , mighty wall, and we , would lay on the , grassy bank and , watch it gurgle by the , lily pads., ,     That spring that , pleasant spot became , the doorway through , which our city of , Trinsic let in the , monstrous deformed , humanoids that , savaged us., ,     I lay upon that , grassy bank and , watched them wade , in, their coarse hair , wet and matted, algae , and muck festooning , their wild brows. , They caught sight of a , quicksilver girl with , bright blond hair and , lively eyes.

	contents	{ ABOUT THE , AUTHOR:, Martin was, for most , of his life, the , Weaponsmaster of , Serpent's Hold, until , his death at 92, of an , overgrown bunion., ,     These are the basic , element to consider in , assessing a weapon of , which all warrior , who regard , themselves as more , than mere , mercenaries should be , aware. First and most , obvious is the amount , of damage that the , weapon may do against , unprotected flesh. , While 'tis this that , first attracts the , attention of the novice, , 'tis a deadly mistake to , regard it as the sole , value of a weapon. , While it may prove , devastating indeed as a , means of causing , damage, a weapon , must also serve as , stout shield when , engaged in combat., ,     Hence the second , issue to which to pay , attention is the amount , of protection that a , weapon may offer. , Pay close attention to , the guard on it, if it be , a blade, or the , stoutness of it's wood , if it is a polearm. Oft , related to this is the , wait of a weapon, for , a heavy weapon is , more difficult to , maneuver to block , with, though it may do , more damage to they , opponent. If a weapon , is too heavy for the , wielder to move it , freely, they should , choose another and not , attempt to prove their , prowess by the size , of their sword., ,     The reach of the , weapon both increase , its defensive ability, , and renders it more , useful in open spaces , as it allows attack , against the opponent , without the need to , close. But be aware of , the limitations of thy , weapon! For a weapon , with great reach may , be useless in close , quarter, for lack of , space to maneuver it. , Should that , dagger-wielding , enemy close on thee , and they halberd, 'tis , best to flee., ,     Lastly, a factor that , must always be , considered is the , condition of the , weapon. It might be a , wondrous magical , blade of surpassing , sharpness and it may , leap to block blows , with a mind of its , own. It also might be , of such flimsy , construction, or , damaged to such an , extent, that the first , time it clangs against , steel, 'twill shatter , into useless shards. , Seek ye a good , blacksmith should , they weapon become , damaged, but be aware , that their , ministrations may , simply make the , matter worse., ,     While mages of , some ability oft create , magical weapons , which enhance skill, , are preternaturally , sharp, or incinerate , the enemy as they , fall, to mind the , greatest gift that they , can grant a stout , sword is to make it , resistant to damage, , for they own skill can , make up the , difference. Except , for the fireball, but if , the corpse is charred, , then so will be the , possessions, which , maketh looting , difficult!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	Ethical hedonism: an introduction
	contents	{     Societies oft have , common codes of , conduct which it , expects all its people to , abide by. Now, while , 'tis true that this can , offer some , advantages, most of , the codes I see today , around Britannia have , fatal flaws. Let us , examine them., ,     First, there is , Blackthorn's code of , Chaos or basically , Anarchy. Whereas , this affords the , individual maximum , opportunity for , individuality and even , pursuit of personal , happiness, it does not , offer even basic , interpersonal conduct , codes to prevent people , from killing each , other., ,     Without such basic , tenets, all the people , will need to spend a , significant portion of , their time and effort , towards personal , protection and thus , less time towards , other more beneficial , pursuits., ,     Then there are the , moral codes that are so , popular today. These , codes are built largely , on historical tradition , rather than current , logic and thus are also , antiquated. For , example many moral , codes we see today , include statements , about not eating certain , foods that once were , often poisonous, but , today can be prepared , safely., ,     Many forbid , contact between young , people of the opposite , gender, which can in , fact be hazardous; but , the codes often have , lost the context as to , why this is done, , instead merely calling , it amoral. In this day , and age to call that a , necessary moral , would need a new , reasoning. I put forth , that tradition is not , enough., ,     Then there are Lord , British's Virtues. It , strikes me that while , a system of virtues is , wonderful as a , touchstone to guide a , society to good , behavior, these are , but shades of the , underlying truth as to , why one may wish to , live a life according to , certain rules of , conduct., ,     On the other hand, , clearly the Virtues , that I have heard Lord , British speak of are , clearly positive codes , of conduct, far better , than the world of , anarchy that Lord , Blackthorn suggests. , Yet, are not these , Virtues still derived , from a set of , principles which , though they sound , good, are difficult to , pin down as actual, , undeniable, rational , truths?, ,     Worse yet though , imagine a society , who's code of conduct , was based on pure , survival of the , strongest. While this , society may function , and even accomplish , much, it can be fairly , argued that personal , happiness would , suffer greatly except , for those at the top. To , rule that out, , however, we must , first believe that , people have a right to , pursue happiness., ,     I hope is a safe , assumption that all , beings wish to be , happy; I will broadly , describe this as , Hedonism. Yet, if all , people did is live a life , of hedonism, their , hedonism might be in , conflict with those , near them, so I will , use the term Ethics to , describe limits one , might put on one's , hedonistic tendencies , to allow others to , pursue their , happiness as well., ,     Allow me to give , this example: If one , were to live alone on a , desert isle, one could , live a life of pure , hedonism, for no , action one might take , could interfere with , another's right to , pursue their , happiness. Poison the , lake if you like, there , is no one to blame but , yourself!, ,     Now suppose two of , you live on that island. , Thou dost not want , thy neighbor to feel , free to poison the lake. , Would it not be better , to consider it unethical , to poison the lake , without first thinking , of those whose , pursuit of happiness , might be affected by , this action?, ,     I put forth that it is , the fact that we as a , people choose to live in , groups known as a , society that causes us , to compromise our , pure hedonism with , logical ethics. , Likewise we accept not , being able to kill , others without reason, , because our own , pursuit of happiness , would be greatly , interfered with if we , feared others would , do the same to us. , From this basis of , logic can be formed , the Tenets of Ethical , Hedonism., ,     For more on this , subject, see the , Tenants of Ethical , Hedonism, by Richard , Garriott and Herman , Miller., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	contents	{     While 'tis true that , the musician who , seeketh only to make , sweet music for , herself and for , others needs little , more than some talent, , and stern practice at , the chosen instrument , those of us who seek , the open road shall , find indeed that a , greater skill is , required. Herein , discover those secrets , which I have learned , over the years as an , itinerant performer.., ,     Once I was in , Jhelom, and accidently , angered the bravo of , some local repute, , whose blade flickered , all too eagerly near my , slender neck (for I , was young then). , After various threats , to "ruin my pretty , face" this bravo , grabbed my arm in a , most unseemly , fashion and tossed me , into a barbaric , enclosure locally , entitled a dueling pit. , My plaintive cries for , help went unheeded , by the guards, for the , inhabitants of Jhelom , are eager indeed to , measure fighting , prowess at any time!, ,     What saved me was , the ability to , improvise a melody , and tune that satirized , the proceedings, and , sufficiently angered , an onlooker to prod , him to coming to my , defense. Once that , fight was underway I , was able to make good , my escape. Hence, I , regard the ability to , incite fights as , indispensable to the , prudent bard., ,     Upon another , occasion, 'twas the , obverse side of that , coin which saved me , for I was being held , prisoner by a , particularly nasty , band of ruffians who , had seized me , unawares from the , road to Vesper., ,     They had worked , themselves into a , frenzy and were , ready to attack and I , fear, tear me limb , from limb, when I , began to sing , frantically, tapping , my fallen drum wit , my tied up feet. The , melody developed into , a soothing one, and the , brigands slowly , calmed down to the , extent of apologizing, , and they let me go!, ,     A final example I , would pray you grant , your attention: once I , was lost upon a large , isle far to the east of , the mainland, well , beyond Serpent's Hold, , where lava made its , sluggish way across , the surface landscape. , And this accursed , land was filled with , vile beats and cunning , dragons., ,     I was being pursued , by one of said fell , dragons when I found , myself trapped. I , quickly skirted a , bubbling pool of molten , rock and attempted to , hide. The dragon , scented me and was , preparing to skirt the , pool, when I began to , play a lusty tune upon , my lute that attracted , its attention. , Mesmerized and , enticed by the melody, , it stepped directly , towards me, and into , the lava-where its , foot was so burned , that it quickly hopped , away, undignified and , annoyed., ,     'Tis my fond hope , that other travelling , minstrels shall learn , from my experience , and apply themselves , to practicing these , skills in order to , preserve life and , limb., , -Sarah of Yew, Songmistress, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  }

	title	My book
	contents	{     'Twas on a chill , night, when the moon , shone pasty-faced , above the horizon, , balanced on the towers , of Lord British's , castle, that the events , I am about to relate took , place, some years ago , now. I witnessed them , all from my tiny , mousehole., ,     Milords British and , Blackthron are , accustomed to a game , of chess 'pon an , evening, over which , they argue the issues , that affect the course , of the realm. Lord , Blackthorn was on his , way to Lord British's , chambers, and Lord , British stood by a , window casement, , just having finished , setting the pieces upon , the board., ,     Suddenly the , shutters blew open, , and Lord British fell , to the ground, one , hand shileding his , eyes. A chill wind , entered the room, and , it seemd a gash was , torn in the very air. , Through the gas I , could see stars and , swirling clouds of , stellar dust, and a , coldness sucked all , the warmth from the , air. A terrible wind , tossed books and , blankets across the , room, and furniture , toppled., ,     From within this , gash issued a great , voice, unlike any I , have ever heard. And , these are the words it , spoke (for I , memorized them most , carefully):, ,     "Greetings, Lord , British. I am the Time , Lord, a being from , beyond your , dimension, as thou art , from a world other , than Sosaria. I am , here to bring thee , warning. Dost thou , recall how long ago , mysterious Stranger , came to Sosaria and , saved the world from , the evil wizard , Mondain? He , shattered the Gem of , Immortality, within , which dwelled a , perfect likeness of , this world.", ,     Lord British slowly , stood and faced the , hole in the air. "I , remember," he said. , "Oft have I wished , that stranger would , return.", ,     "He hath returned," , spoke the voice. "But , not to here. When the , Gem was shattered, a , thousand shards were , scattered across the , dimensions, and in , each shard there is a , perfect likeness of , this world. And thou , dost live upon one such , shard, for thou art not , of the true , world-thou art , merely a reflection.", ,     Lord British looked , shaken by this, and I , did not know what to , think! Was I merely a , shadow of the real , me, which lives still , somewhere else , across uncounted , universes?, ,     "My task is to heal , this shattered world, , Lord British," said the , voice. "And I seek to , enlist thee in my , cause. Be warned that , in this case, healing , carries with it a , terrible price.", ,     Concern warred , with curiosity on my , liege's face, but ever , one to shoulder a , burden, he , straightened and faced , the gash in the air , bravely. "Name thy , price.", ,     "A shard of a , universe is a , powerful thing, and , universe shattered is , always in danger , from the powers of , darkness. Already , three shards were , turned to evil, and sent , to plague the original , universe in the form , of Shadowlords. , Many times have I , brought the Stranger , back to Britannia, to , preserve it from its , own folly or from , outside dangers. Yet , as long as the world , remaineth in pieces, it , remaineth vulnerable. , We must bring the , shards into harmony, , so that they resonate , in such a manner that , matches the original , universe. Then the , two universes shall , merge, and be again as , one., ,     "But if we are only , shadows..." Lord , British said , wonderingly., ,     The light from the , stars within the hole , seemed to dim. , "Indeed, the , reflections shall , become one with the , orginal. Thou wouldst , cease to be as thou art, , and become part of the , larger you. Thou shalt , not die; however, , uncounted generations , have passed and borne , children since that , day, and they have no , counterparts. They , would perish utterly." , Lord British sagged in , shock, realizing the , terrible price that , would be paid to heal , the universe. "All of , my people," he , breathed., ,     "Tis for the , greateer good.", ,     Lord British bowed , his head., ,     'Twas then I saw , the movement by the , door, half-hid by the , heavy red curtains. , Lord Blackthron stood , there, concealed from , the rest of the room, , his face white. How , long had he been , listening? I cannot , say, yet I suspect that , he had heard all that , the mysterious voice , had to say., ,     "How then, shall I , aid thee?" Lord , British said, , weariness in his , voice., ,     "Aid the nobility , that resideth in , human heart. Protect , the Virtues that so , recently came to thee , in thought late at , night. They are the , Virtues of life, as , your counterpart , understands them to , be. For when thy , populace doth live and , breathe these Virtues , shall it match the true , Britannia, and thy , shard shall rejoin , with it.", ,     The gash in the air , began to close, and , with it warmth stole , back into the room., ,     "I was going to , discuss my idea with , Blackthorn tonight," , Lord British breathed. , "Have I no thoughts , that are my own?

	title	A grammar of orcish
	contents	{ This volume, and , others in the series, , are sponsored by , donations from Lord , Blackthorn, ever a , supporter of , understanding the , other sentient races of , Britannia. -, , , The Orcish tongue , may fall unpleasingly , 'pon the ear, yet it has , within it a complex , grammar oft , misunderstood by , those who merely , hear the few broken , words of English our , orcish brothers , manage without , education., , These are the basic , rules of orcish:, , Orcish has five , tenses: present, past, , future imperfect, , present interjectional, , and prehensile., Examples: gugroflu, , gugrofloog, gugrobo, , gugrolu!, gugrogug., , All transitive verbs in , the prehensile tense , end it "ug.", Examples: urgleighug, , biggugdaghgug, , curdakalmug., , All present , interjectional , conjugations start , with the letter G , unless they contain , the third declensive , accent of the letter U., Examples: , ghothudunglug, but n , azhbuugub., , The past tense can , only refer to events , since the last meal, , but the prehensile , tense can refer to any , event within reach., , The present tense is , conjugated like the , future imperfect , tense, when the , interrogative mode is , used by pitching the , sound a quarter-tone , higher., , Orcish hath no concept , of person, as in first , person, third person, , I, we, etc., , Orcish grammar , relies upon the three , cardinal rules of , accretion, prefixing, , and agglutination, in , addition to pitch. In the , former, phonemes , combine into larger , words which may , contain full phrasal , significance. In the , second, prefixing , specific phonetic , sounds changes the , subject of the , sentence into object, , interrogative, , addressed individual, , or dinner., , Agglutination occurs , whenever four of the , same letter are , present in a word, in , which case, any two , of them may be , removed or slurred., , Pitch changes the , phoneme value of , individual syllables, , thus completely , altering what a word , may mean. The , classic example if , "Aktgluthugrot , bigglogubuu , dargilgaglug , lublublub" which can , mean "You are such a , pretty girl," "My , mother ate your , primroses," or , "Jellyfish nose paints , alms potato," depending , on pitch., , Orcish poetry often , relies upon repeating , the same phrase in , multiple pitches, even , changing pitch , midword. None of , this great are is , translatable., ,     The orcish language , uses the following , vowels: ab, ad, ag, akt, , at, augh, auh, azh, e, , i, o, oo, u, uu. The , vowel sound a is not , recognized as a vowel , and does not exist in , their alphabet. The , orcish alphabet is best , learned using the , classic rhyme , repeated at 23 , different pitchs:, ,     Lugnog ghu blat , suggaroglug. Gaghbuu , dakdar ab highugbo, , Gothnogbuim ad , gilgubbugbuilug , Bilgeaugh thurggulg , stuiggro!, , A translation of the , first pitch:, Eat food, the first , letter is ab,, Kill people, the next , letter is ad,, I forget the rest But , augh is in there , somewhere!, , ,     What follows is a , complete phonetic , library of the orcish , language: ab, ad, ag, , akt, alm, at, augh, , auh, azh, ba, ba, bag, , bar, baz, bid, bilge, bo, , bog, bog, brui, bu, , buad, bug, bug, buil, , buim, bum, buo, buor, , buu, ca, car, clog, cro, , cuk, cur, da, dagh, , dagh, dak, dar, deak, , der, dil, dit, dor, dre, , dri, dru, du, dud, duf, , dug, dug, duh, dun, , eag, eg, egg, eichel, ek, , ep, ewk, faugh, fid, , flu, fog, foo, foz, , fruk, fu, fub, fud, , fun, fup, fur, gaa, , gag, gagh, gan, gar, gh, , gha, ghat, ghed, ghid, , gho, ghu, gig, gil, gka, , glu, glu, glug, gna, gno, , gnu, gol, gom, goth, , grunt, grut, gu, gub, , gub, gug, gug, gugh, , guk, guk,, ,     (Transcriber's , Note: The remainder , of the orcish language , is not present in this , tome.
