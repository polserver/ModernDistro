		<p>This is a new gump system to replace the old one. 
			In this new system, gumps are handled in a more object 
			oriented manner, and are no longer dealt with globally. 
			The code is more optimized so the gumps will not take as 
			many cycles to be generated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It was also setup so the function prototypes are similar 
			to the old one for faster migration times.
		</p>	
			Included is a text command, called previewgump.src that 
			shows how a gump can be assembled. It shows various tricks 
			and techniques that can be used to put one together.
		<p>	
			Also, the long list of graphical constants in the gumps.inc
			were removed and placed in a config file. See GumpCfgInfo()
			in gumps_ex.inc for more information.
