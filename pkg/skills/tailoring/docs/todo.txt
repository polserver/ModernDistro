Unraveling? From UO.com:
As your clothing grows older, you may wish to give it new life by sewing it into a new item. To gain cloth from used clothing items:
* Double-click scissors in your inventory.
* Target the item you wish to unravel.
The amount of cloth gained is dependent on your Tailoring skill.
