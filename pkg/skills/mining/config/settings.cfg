	// to the dynamically placed ore veins. This number pertains to each

// This is a list of all the ores currently defined for the Distro.
// This list is used to create a Global ore spot in :mining/pickaxe/use.src.
// There is no "weight" or percent chance for one ore to be preferred over another.
// They all have an equal chance of being created. If you want to make some of them rarer
// than others you can remove the ones you want to be rare from this list.
// Then create veins for the rare ones.
// Please note that I have entered them in order of the number elemental
// properties they possess. Iron ore has no properties. Dull copper has 1 elemental
// property. Shadow has 3. etc. There is one exception. SilverOre is not a standard
// ore on OSI. It has no elemental properties. However, I intend to give it a better
// damage value when used on undead.
