      </div>
      <div id="content"><big id="fred">The sysbook package is in reality two
          halves of
          a whole books package. The first half provides a way to have blank
          books for players to write stories, create lists of merchandise or
          whatever they wish to put in a book. The other half of the sysbook
          package allows developers to create books containing stories or other
          written content. The content can be about the shard for background and
          role-play purposes, guides for various skills or anything you want
          your
          players to be able to read in-game. The books created with content or
          stories can be added to the sysbook library configuration file and to
          the data file. This package allows you to have these books spawn
          randomly in bookshelves of your choice. In order for one of these
          books
          to spawn in a bookshelf the book must be transferred to the
          configuration file, books.cfg located in the sysbook config directory.
          This is the “Master Library”. The books stored in the Master Library
          cannot be deleted by any command. Once they are added to the Master
          Library they can be added to the staticbooks data file, the Shard
          Library. There are commands to add or remove books to, or from, the
          Shard Library. Elements cannot be deleted from the Master Library by
          eScript programmes. It must be edited in a text editor. Thus only a
          developer will be able to delete books from the Master Library. I
          provide a list of the commands and their descriptions later in this
          read me file.</big><br>
        <hr><big>A quick note about the Master and Shard Libraries: This was
          inspired, well more than inspired, suggested, by Nando. So a big thank
          you to him. The Master Library, as it is for the most part permanent,
          allows a developer or admin to add books for use at various times of
          the year or for special events without them spawning in the
          bookshelves
          until they are added to the Shard Library. Books in the Master Library
          cannot be created in-game, either by commands or by the book spawn
          system. To make a book from the Master Library available in-game it
          must first be added to the Shard Library. See the sysbook commands
          section.<br>
